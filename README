[x] Need hipparcos distances, absolute luminosities and dereddened colors

# Check all data are RV'd and norm'd OK.

[x] Check that all data are binned on the same pixels.

# Build cannon model with luminosities and colors

# Cross-validation tests: estimate % and confirm it does not vary as fraction of distnace.




Notes:
- Ignored 18 Sco and the Sun because they had a different number a pixels than the rest of the stars
